# Predicting Anti-Cancer Drug Response through Transformer-Based Methods

### Data Availability
This project utilizes two datasets in combination
- [CCLE](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/)
- [GDSC](https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle/)


### Approach
We aim to develop a lightweight, computationally efficient transformer-based model for predicting drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines using CCLE-GDSC data. Our objective is to achieve comparable or improved accuracy in IC50 and AUC predictions while reducing model size and inference time compared to existing deep learning approaches.
